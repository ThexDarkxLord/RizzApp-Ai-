# 💬 Rizz App AI — Smooth Talk Generator 😎🔥

Rizz App AI is a lightweight project that generates fun, confident,
smooth “rizz” (flirty / charismatic replies).  
This repo includes two simple versions:

- 🌐 **HTML version** — a full chat interface in a **single light-theme file**  
  (`RizzApp.html`)
- 🐍 **Python version** — an image-chat AI that analyzes images with OCR  
  (`rizzapp.py`)

Both versions are clean, beginner-friendly, and easy to customize.
